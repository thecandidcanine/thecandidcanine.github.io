<h1>Training Philosophy:</h1>
<p>The Candid Canineâ€™s training philosophy is informed by the most current research in canine cognition, animal behavior, and learning theory in order to make sure we're working with your dog in a way it will understand and respond to. Positive reinforcement, counter-conditioning and clicker training are all proven techniques that work by rewarding the animal for the desired behavior and replacing negative or unwanted behaviors with something you want - no yelling 'no' or yanking on a leash needed! By removing punishment and harsh equipment from the skill set I teach you, the dogs I work with eagerly engage with their owners to accomplish desired behaviors and truly love their training experience.</p>

<h2>Ethics and Methods:</h2>

<p>The Candid Canine believes in the Least Intrusive, Minimally Aversive approach to behavior modification and dog training standardized by the International Association of AnimalBehavior Consultants (IAABC).</p>
